#Through the Lens 



**Art / Photography Blog** 
    
My app through the lens will allow users to upload anytype of art they find inspiring. Whether it be photography or just cute cartoons, the users will be able to add links of the images they like.    

**AAU:**

I want to see art posted by other users. 

I want to add art images. 

I want to read a brief description of what the art is about. 

I want to see who the artist is. 

I want to flag images if in poor taste. 

I want to protect art from being added, edited, or removed by users who do not have an account with the app. 

I want to search art by the artist / mood / tags /  title.

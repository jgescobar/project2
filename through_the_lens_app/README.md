#Through the Lens

##**Art / Photography Blog** 
    
My app through the lens will allow users to upload any type of art they find inspiring. It will also allow them to upload hip technologies and trendy coffeeshops anywhere around the world by posting a link and editing the appropriate fields for such categories. Lastly, music enthusiasts will be able to post youtube embed links on the Music category forum and write mini descriptions so they can share awesome music videos with other music enthusiasts. Giphs also work for those who get excited about giphs. 

	
##**Some of the technologies I used were:**
	
	1) Ruby on Rails
	2) CSS Bootstrap
	3) HTML
	4) Git
	5) GitHub
	6) Heroku
	7) Trello
	

**AAU:**

[X] I want to see art posted by other users. 

[X] I want to add art images. 

[X] I want to read a brief description of what the art is about. 

[X] I want to see who the artist is. 

[X] I want to protect art from being added, edited, or removed by users who do not have an account with the app.

**Things that I hope to fix in the future**

[] I'd like to be able to delete posts I do not like as the administrator without having to delete through the database. 

[] I'd like to make the music videos exapand when a user clicks on the music video. 

[] I'd like to allow people who are not signed up to see other user's posts. They will not be able to posts content without signing up however. 

[] I'd like to add tags to allow for searching.

#Through the Lens

##**Art / Photography Blog** 
    
My app through the lens will allow users to upload any type of art they find inspiring. It will also allow them to upload hip technologies and trendy coffeeshops anywhere around the world by posting a link and editing the appropriate fields for such categories. Lastly, music enthusiasts will be able to post youtube embed links on the Music category forum and write mini descriptions so they can share awesome music videos with other music enthusiasts. Giphs also work for those who get excited about giphs. 

	
##**Some of the technologies I used were:**
	
	1) Ruby on Rails
	2) CSS Bootstrap
	3) JavaScript
	4) HTML 
	5) Git 
	6) GitHub
	7) Heroku
	8) Trello
